“Just One More Thing” – optimize the last few bytes in a Deflate stream. 🕵🏼‍♂️

<hr>

An ongoing investigation into:

- [DeflOpt](http://web.archive.org/web/20131208161446/http://www.walbeehm.com/download/index.html) v2.07 (05-Sep-2007) by Ben Jos Walbeehm.

- [defluff](https://web.archive.org/web/20230604215335/https://encode.su/threads/1214-defluff-a-deflate-huffman-optimizer) v0.3.2 (07-Apr-2011) by Joachim Henke. 

- [deft4j](https://github.com/NeRdTheNed/deft4j) v1.0.0-beta-17 (12-Nov-2023) by Ned Loynd.

This project focuses on reverse-engineering the techniques used to save the last few bytes from PNG image files. This work is undertaken by binary analysis of the processed files, _without_ accessing the source code of other programs.
